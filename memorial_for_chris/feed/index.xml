					<description><![CDATA[I was a lithic archaeologist in the 1970s and met Chris through Clay Singer, Fred Budinger, and Ruth D. Simpson at the Calico Early Man Site in California  and later with Dr. Jeannie Binning in the Valley. Chris was experimenting with his bipolar cobble splitting as a core reduction  methodology. He had an article in the Flintknapper&#039;s  Exchange back then on the subject.  I went to Jeannie&#039;s house and there was a massive lithic scatter in the front room and overflowing out the back deck, Chris and Jeannie had been flintknapping  and doing lithic experiments in the living room for weeks!

Chris about himself, in his own words:
https://www.earthmeasure.com/chris_hardaker_bio.html  &quot;
I was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. in 1952. My first archaeology class was twenty years later in the S.F. Bay Area, Foothill College, and months later worked a local prehistoric site as part of a summer course. Addicted, I soon joined the ranks of largely student archaeologists working in contract archaeology. In 1976, a BA in anthropology, minor: comparative religions, at San Diego State. In 1989, a MA in anthropology from the University of Arizona. Professionally, I have always been interested in lithics. Geometry unlocked the sacred architecture of Chaco Canyon, which unexpectedly led me to the discoveries in Washington, D.C.

Lithics, like the cartoon says, are everywhere. Stone tools are critical because they are usually the only artifact class that survives the vicissitudes of environmental forces, especially the farther back you go in time. There are three lithic reduction methods: bipolar flaking, block-on-block, and unipolar/percussion (inc. pressure). All specific flintknapping techniques are drawn from these primary methods. All lithics are generated by these methods. With this knowledge you can be anywhere in the world and have a grasp for what you might find under your feet, even if it is more than a million years old. It is a knowledge that is invaluable for assessing the Artifact vs. Geofact controversies. The 200,000 year old Calico Early Man site is perhaps the greatest, most controversial example. No such problems faced the archaeologists at the Valsequillo Reservoir outside Puebla, Mexico fifty years ago. They found spearheads and other cutting tools next to the mineralized bones of elephants, camels and horses, in immaculate archaeological context. Their controversy was the date: 250,000 years.

Native American geometry is a specification of the larger realm of cultural geometry traditions. Sacred/classical geometry is a simple universal method that provides a concrete standard by which to assess any specific cultural use and expression of geometry. Sacred geometry is bare bones geometry, a foundation that erupts naturally out of a circle. Everyone used circles, going back tens of thousands of years. Like the universality of lithics, geometry can occur anywhere you find art and architecture. Even Washington, D.C.

Have fun and prosper.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very sad news. Chris is one of my oldest friends. We were in college together in the &#039;70s at San Diego State University, and shared many passionate interests including Native California and the Book of Changes (I Ching). We roomed together for more than one stretch, both in southern California and Tucson, Arizona, and kept in close touch by email and snail mail till recently. Fearing the worst, after several weeks of not hearing from Chris, I googled and found this page. I&#039;m going to miss him greatly. So will our many mutual friends.]]></description>
